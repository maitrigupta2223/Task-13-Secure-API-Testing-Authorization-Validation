# Task-13-Secure-API-Testing-Authorization-Validation


## Objective
To test REST APIs for authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting, and error handling issues.

## Tools Used
- Postman
- Public Test API (reqres.in)

## Tests Performed
- API authentication testing
- Unauthenticated access testing
- Authorization testing (IDOR)
- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting testing
- HTTP response code analysis

## Key Observations
- Unauthorized requests were blocked
- No IDOR vulnerabilities were observed
- Malformed inputs were restricted
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention were enforced
- Error messages were generic and secure

## OWASP API Risk Mapping
- No critical OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities were identified

## Final Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience in API security testing and reinforced secure API design principles.
